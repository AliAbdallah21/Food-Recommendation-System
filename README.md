# üçΩÔ∏è Intelligent Food Recommendation System

This project implements an **intelligent food recommendation system** that leverages a **vector database (ChromaDB)** for efficient semantic search and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**‚Äîspecifically from **OpenAI**‚Äîfor natural language understanding and conversational responses.

The system supports a full range of food discovery‚Äîfrom basic keyword search to advanced, AI-powered, contextual recommendations.

## üöÄ Features

* **üîç Semantic Food Search** Uses `sentence-transformer` embeddings to find conceptually similar food items, beyond simple keyword matches.

* **üß† RAG Chatbot (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** Combines ChromaDB with OpenAI's LLM to deliver intelligent, contextual food suggestions through natural language.

* **‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Filtering** Search by cuisine type, calorie count, or other metadata.

* **üí¨ Interactive CLI Interfaces** Easy-to-use command-line tools for trying out each recommendation method.

* **üìä System Comparison Tool** A benchmarking script that compares all three systems based on output and performance.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

The project is organized into modular Python files for clarity and reusability:

* `FoodDataSet.json`: The raw dataset containing detailed information about various food items.
* `shared_functions.py`: Contains all the core, reusable backend logic, including data loading, ChromaDB collection creation, population, and various similarity search functions. This acts as the project's central library.
* `interactive_search.py`: Implements a basic command-line interface for quick, semantic food discovery.
* `advanced_search.py`: Provides a command-line interface with advanced filtering capabilities (e.g., by cuisine, calories) on top of semantic search.
* `enhanced_rag_chatbot.py`: The main script for the RAG-powered conversational chatbot, integrating OpenAI's LLM with the vector database.
* `system_comparison.py`: A utility script to run predefined tests and compare the performance and output of all three recommendation systems.
* `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python dependencies required to run the project, ensuring easy environment setup.
* `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories that Git should ignore (e.g., temporary files, cache).

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Food Recommendation System on your local machine.

### üìã Prerequisites

* **Python 3.8+**
* **Git** (for cloning the repository)
* An **OpenAI API Key** (required for the RAG Chatbot)

### ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/AliAbdallah21/Food-Recommendation-System.git](https://github.com/AliAbdallah21/Food-Recommendation-System.git)
    cd Food-Recommendation-System
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### üîë OpenAI API Key Setup

The `enhanced_rag_chatbot.py` script requires an OpenAI API Key. You must set this as an environment variable before running the RAG chatbot.

* **For Linux/macOS (in your terminal):**
    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
    ```
* **For Windows (in Command Prompt):**
    ```cmd
    set OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
    ```
* **For Windows (in PowerShell):**
    ```powershell
    $env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
    ```
    Replace `"your_openai_api_key_here"` with your actual API key.

## üí° Understanding the Systems

### üíª Command Line Interface (CLI)

All systems in this project utilize a **Command Line Interface (CLI)**. This means you interact with the program by typing text commands into your terminal and receiving text-based output. There are no graphical windows, buttons, or visual elements to click. This approach is excellent for demonstrating core logic and backend functionality.

There are no graphical windows, buttons, or visual elements to click. This approach is excellent for demonstrating core logic and backend functionality.

### üß† Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Explained

The RAG Chatbot is a prime example of a RAG architecture, which involves three key steps:

1.  **Retrieval:** When you ask a question (e.g., "Suggest a healthy Italian meal"), the system first performs a semantic search on the ChromaDB vector database to find the most relevant food items.
2.  **Augmentation / Context Building:** The raw information from these retrieved food items (descriptions, ingredients, calories, etc.) is then formatted into a concise, structured "context" that is easy for an LLM to understand.
3.  **Generation:** This structured context, along with your original query, is then sent to OpenAI's LLM. The LLM uses this combined input to generate a natural, conversational, and factually grounded response. This prevents the LLM from "hallucinating" information and ensures its recommendations are based on your specific food database.
